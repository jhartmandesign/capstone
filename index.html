          >I do have a lot of experience in aftereffects, but I wanted to see if I could create elements in aftereffects
          that could be imported into figma or XD. Additionally, I wanted to learn to use AfterEffects for UI/UX
          elements, something I had never done before.<br /><br /></span

        ><span class="sofiapro-regular-normal-black-30px"
          >Difficult, gimmicky, and super unlikely.<br />It was a breeze creating the actual animations, but planning
          ahead the 4 animations involved in a menu open and close was a lengthy process, let alone doing this a hundred
          times for every interaction. Additionally, only XD can really use these elements, a fact that supports me
          learning XD but really added a damper to my progress. I cut this prototype short as it clearly wasnâ€™t going to
          be super viable until further development.</span
